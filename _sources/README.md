# Hello Universe

The repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the Hello Universe project, an initiative at MAST to provide a space for applying machine learning (ML) algorithms to astronomical data. The first set of notebooks are designed to span a range of ML techniques, and to highlight MAST mission data, including user-contributed high-level science products (HLSPs).
